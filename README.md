# Flutter Algolia Search Example

This is a simple Algolia search example in Flutter. It closely aligns with
[Algolia's example](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/how-to/flutter/ios/),
with less configuration needed thanks to the unofficial [Algolia Search package](https://pub.dev/packages/algolia).
Infinite scroll was also added to load more results when available.

Algolia's example `applicationId`, `apiKey` and `index` included. Be sure to replace these with your own.
